This is the [Clojure](http://clojure.org) implementation of Scrabbli, a simple scrabble board tool solver. 

## Installation

Download the jar from downloads.
Right now there is no jar, as there is not even a working program.

    $ java -jar scrabbli-clj-0.1.0-standalone.jar [port]

## Options

This app accepts an option which allows you to choose which port to run it on. If none is provided, it defaults to 80.
